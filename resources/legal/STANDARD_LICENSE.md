# Standard License

This is a work-in-progress draft of my standard license for
software that I sell (It would apply, for example, when I'm contracted
to build a system for a client).

DISCLAIMER: This is not a legally binding license to use any of my software,
it is just a generic template that I am willing to apply to any contract
or sales involving software I develop.

## Overview in Layman's Terms


## Reasoning for the Terms

I produce code that benefits from the cumulation of my years worth of
experience. The end product may be the concept of the client, but the actual
implementation is mine. I will often re-use functions that I have written to do
certain tasks - they're part of my own little pseudo-framework. They're things
that I've worked on, adjusted, and improved for years. In short, they're my
specialised tools of trade.

In general, I will keep copyright on any code that I produce. I won't claim
copyright over the concept of the project, or any specific business logic that
the client has provided, because that is their IP. The specific implementation
is my IP. When I license the final product to the client, they get a license
which allows them to use and modify my code for this specific product, and no
other product.

What this means for the client is this:
* They may use the code
* They may change the code
* They may pay someone else to change the code
* They can sell the code once (and once only - the license will transfer with ownership of the code, in which case the new owner gets the same rights to use/modify/sell the code)

They can not:
* Sell copies of the code (unless agreed upon and licensed to do so by me, which will generally attract a higher fee)
* Take parts of my code and use it in another product/project
* Let another developer take parts of my code and use them in other products/projects
* Open-source or otherwise re-license my code (without my approval)

In short - the code I write is single use, and if they want another use out of
it, they have to re-license my code for that. It really doesn't affect the
client at all 99% of the time, and if it does (maybe they want me to build a
system that they can re-sell as copies), then we can discuss it, and come to a
better licensing agreement.

It protects my code, and my accumulated knowledge from being used to compete
against me, as well as helps prevent my code from spreading to locations where
I have no contact or control.

If a client wants to purchase the copyright to the code as well, then I'll
generally quadrupedal my fee, and use none of my standard library of functions.
The project will also take longer, because I have to re-build code concepts
that I've used before. This is also done to protect my other clients, because
signing over copyright to code that I've used before means that now all of the
old projects may technically be infringing copyright which I don't have the
right to license.
