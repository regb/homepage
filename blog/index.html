        <p class="post-excerpt">The Scala ecosystem offers a unique opportunity to do cross-platform game
development with full access to the native API of each platform. And I’m not
talking about making an HTML5 game with Scala.js and wraping it in web views
to run everywhere, I’m talking true native compilation by leveraging the
various platforms on which Scala runs, that is the JVM, Scala.js, and
Scala Native. With all these platforms, a game can be written once, and then
compiled:

        <h2 class="post-title">Fish Escape, a Remake Three Years in the Making</h2>
        <p class="post-excerpt">About five years ago, I published Rat Trap, my first ever
completed game.  It was a project that taught me a lot about game
development. I had had a
few attempts at making games in the past, but it never worked out.  With Rat
Trap, I finally made a complete game that I published on a real platform, the
Google Play
Store.

        <h2 class="post-title">Scala, the Small Parts</h2>
        <p class="post-excerpt">In Less is More, we discussed how
Scala has a few, well-chosen, and independent features that combine in
countless ways to provide the expressive features of Scala as we know it.
However, the discussion remained mostly conceptual, with few examples. In this
post, I want to highlight several more examples that will make the whole
argument more concrete, so that you don’t need to take my word for it.

        <h2 class="post-title">Less is More</h2>
        <p class="post-excerpt">Scala has the reputation of being a complicated and bloated language. This
impression comes from the large variety of libraries, architectures, and styles
out there. Since developers have so many ways of using the language, the
argument goes that the language is just an overly complicated mix of every
programming languages features ever invented. This couldn’t possibly be further
from the truth.

        <p class="post-excerpt">As we all know, blue is the best color in Magic, and the most fun to play. Ok, maybe
not everybody will agree with the latter, but surely blue has had some of the most
broken cards ever printed. It is also the most played color in Legacy. Part of it is due
to the consistency that the blue cantrips bring.

        <p class="post-excerpt">They always say — building it is the easy part. I suppose this has some truth
in it, but I would never have expected spending so much time to get my app
passed the publishing process. I have been working a few hundreds of hours,
during my free time, to complete my new game, and Google simply shattered all
of that by rejecting my app from the Google Play Store.

has been discussing 
the looter problem 
quite extensively lately. So here is my take on the question.

        <p class="post-excerpt">This is probably not a secret for anyone, but I am a big fan of the 
Scala programming language. I’ve been taught 
functional programming first in Scala, and since them I’ve  never looked back. 
So when I decided to get into Android game development, choosing Scala was 
a no-brainer.
