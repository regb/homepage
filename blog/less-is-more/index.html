        <article class="post-content">
          <p>Scala has the reputation of being a complicated and bloated language. This
impression comes from the large variety of libraries, architectures, and styles
out there. Since developers have so many ways of using the language, the
argument goes that the language is just an overly complicated mix of every
programming languages features ever invented. This couldn’t possibly be further
from the truth.</p>

<p>What is true is that Scala is complex. However this complexity is not coming
from the language, it is just the inherent complexity in writing software.
Complexity should also not be confused with complication. Saying that something
is complicated carries a notion that the thing was made complicated for
the sake of it. It could have been made simpler. Complexity is the nature of
the thing, and it’s inherent to the depth of the problem.</p>

<p>Things can be basic or complex, but not both, and things can be simple or
complicated, but not both. A basic problem should be ideally solved by a simple
solution, however it is very common to introduce a complicated solution to a
basic problem. A complex problem can rarely be solved by a simple tool,
although when that happens, that’s usually the product of a genius. And some
problems are just so complex that they require a complicated solution, but it’s
never ideal. Scala is a tool which is not simple, but not complicated either,
made to address a very complex domain.</p>

<p>But I disgress; the essence of the criticisms against Scala often boils down to
its bloated amount of features. Scala does have quite a number of features,
many of them coming from advanced research in programming languages, which
makes it a hard and challenging language to learn. But hard and challenging
does not mean in any way bad. VIM is maybe the best text editor ever invented
(along with Emacs), but it is also one of the hardest to learn and to master.
But the effort eventually pays off, for when one finally understands its design
philosophy, they unlock an unbounded boost in productivity.</p>

<p>Scala has many features, but many of them are orthogonal to each other. What
that means is that each feature brings a unique and necessary aspect to the
language. Its design was actually carefully crafted so that only the minimal
necessary set of features was added to the language. The expressiveness that
people observe with Scala does not come from a large number of features, but
from the powerful synergy among them. Each feature is individually clean and
well-defined, and it can combine with every other features.</p>

<p>Let’s move this abstract discussion to concrete examples: Scala is an
object-oriented language and as such has classes and methods. A method in Scala
is nothing special, you define it as you would define a function, but within a
class:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">IntList</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">append</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">IntList</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">???</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The class represents an immutable list of integers and it has an append` method
to return a new list with a new integer appended to the end of the list.  Let’s
not focus on the implementation, to keep the example to the point. Now, the
class can be used in the expected manner:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">l1</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">IntList</span>  <span class="c1">// l1 = []</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">l2</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="nv">l1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">append</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="c1">// l2 = [1]</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">l3</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="nv">l2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">append</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="c1">// l3 = [1, 2]</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">l4</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="nv">l3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">append</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="c1">// l4 = [1, 2, 3]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Most object-oriented languages use a similar syntax for defining and calling
methods. Scala has a syntactic rule where methods with a single parameter can
be used in infix notation. Infix notation is a fancy mathematical term that you
can use to flex at parties, but it simply means that the name is used between
the receiver and the argument, without additional syntax, just like a
mathematical operator. Using this rule, the above could alternatively be
written as:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">l1</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">IntList</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">l2</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="n">l1</span> <span class="n">append</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">l3</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="n">l2</span> <span class="n">append</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">l4</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="n">l3</span> <span class="n">append</span> <span class="mi">3</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Not a huge difference, but some people might find the latter more pleasurable
to read. It is a general rule that apply to all objects and all methods (as
long as they have a single formal parameter). Not many Scala programmers would
use this syntax in the above case, as it can make the code actually confusing,
but it is a popular syntax when using higher-order functions:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">inc</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Int</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="k">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">l5</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="n">l4</span> <span class="n">map</span> <span class="n">incr</span> <span class="c1">// l5 = [2, 3, 4]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Of course, one could also use the syntax <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l4.map(incr)</code> but it is somewhat of a
convention to use the infix notation with higher-order functions as it tends to
be more readable (perhaps due to the roots of the notation coming from the
likes of Haskell and Caml). In more standard cases like the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">append</code> function,
it is more natural and readable to use the more familiar and consistant
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">object.method(arg)</code> syntax.</p>

<p>Let us look at another example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Vector</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">x</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Double</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Double</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">plus</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">that</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Vector</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Vector</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Vector</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nv">that</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">a</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">b</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nv">that</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">b</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">v1</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Vector</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">v2</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Vector</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">v3</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="nv">v1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">plus</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">v2</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="c1">// v3 = (3, 4)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is a simple 2D vector and an example of how to use it. It’s very close to
how we would write in a language like Java, except for the short constructor
syntax. This is also the canonical motivating example for why operator
overloading makes sense. Scala supports it, although as a consequence of
another feature: flexible syntax for identifiers. In Scala, identifiers are
very flexible and, in particular, they can contain any combination of standard
symbols (although if they do, they cannot contain <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/02-identifiers-names-and-scopes.html">any other
characers</a>).
Taking advantage of that rule, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plus</code> method could be defined more
naturally as:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Vector</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">x</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Double</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Double</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">+</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">that</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Vector</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Vector</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Vector</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">a</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nv">that</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">a</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">b</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nv">that</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">b</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The language treats <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plus</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> in exactly the same way, so the way we use
the vector remains the same:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">v1</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Vector</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">v2</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Vector</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">v3</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="n">v1</span><span class="o">.+(</span><span class="n">v2</span><span class="o">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That is because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> is just the name of the method and a method can be used
with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">object.method(arg)</code> syntax. Of course, here it makes sense to take
advantage of the infix notation for methods, and we can actually write:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">val</span> <span class="nv">v3</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="n">v1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">v2</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is where operator overloading shines: this reads exactly like the
mathematical description and the intent could not be clearer.</p>

<p>We have just seen how two independent features — infix notation and flexible
syntax for methods — combine elegantly to provide operator overloading. This
is just one of many examples where Scala provides common and powerful features
from two simpler and well-defined ones. But as this post is getting long, let
me take a break there and come back <a href="/blog/scala-the-small-parts/">next time dissecting a few more
examples</a>.</p>
