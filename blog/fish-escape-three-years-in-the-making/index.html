        <article class="post-content">
          <p>About five years ago, I published <a href="/games/rat-trap/">Rat Trap</a>, my first
ever completed game.  It was a project that <a href="/blog/building-an-android-game-with-scala-and-inkscape/">taught me a lot about game
development</a>. I had had a
few attempts at making games in the past, but it never worked out.  With Rat
Trap, I finally made a complete game that I published on a real platform, the
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.regblanc.rattrap">Google Play
Store</a>.</p>

<p>Rat Trap was well received, reaching more than 5000 downloads on Google Play (I
consider this a success, given how many games get less than 10 total
downloads), and averaging around a rating of 4.5 out of 5. I’m particularly
proud of the fact that many of these reviews are from complete strangers, and
they seemed to enjoy the game a lot. Even many of the friends with whom I shared
the game seemed to get somewhat addicted to it, not to please me, but truly
because of the gameplay.</p>

<p>Of course, the game had very questionable graphics (it was all done by myself,
a programmer), no sound, and a general lack of production value. I invested
quite some time in polishing parts of the experience, such as making the
gameplay as intuitive as possible, and easing the player into the game. But it
was clear that the game was lacking in some significant areas to be truly
successful.  However, the core gameplay seemed to stick quite well with most
people, so I always thought that the game had potential, if I could make a much
more polished and neat version.</p>

<h4 id="the-genesis">The Genesis</h4>

<p>Around three years ago, I met a long-term friend of mine for coffee. It was a
general catch-up meeting, but somehow the discussion moved towards game
development ideas. That friend was a freelance graphic designer, so he had a
set of skills that was complementary to mine. We floated the idea that it would
be cool if we were to work on a game together. By that time, I had
self-published two small games, and I was exploring ideas for a next project.</p>

<p>At the end of this meeting, I was excited to work on that project. But at the
time, I was quite busy with a number of other commitments. Besides, I had had a
number of challenging experiences with side-projects in the past few years, so
I thought that jumping into a new one based on a coffee chat might not be the
best of ideas. So I thought, let’s sit on this for a while.</p>

<p>Additionally, waiting a bit was a good test to see if we were actually
motivated by the project. Talking about how we are going to change the world is
always a nice conversation topic, but when it comes to actually doing
something, it’s a whole different story. It’s also fairly common to put in one
or two days of work right after an interesting kick-off meeting, only for the
motivation to die down eventually. By waiting some time and see if we still
want to do this, and then starting to put in some work, I felt like we would
have a more sustainable project.</p>

<p>As you might have guessed — otherwise I wouldn’t be writing this article —
the motivation stayed and about one month later, we decided to meet again about
the project and to start coming up with some concrete tasks. And just like
that, <em>Fish Escape</em> was born.</p>

<p>One ground rule we decided on early on, which I think was essential, was to be
very clear on the work expectations towards each other. And it might not be
what you would expect. We agreed that none of us should expect any work done
from the other, under any fixed timeline. We agreed that there might be entire
months when we wouldn’t be doing anything, and we shouldn’t feel bad about it.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, this was a way to prevent the classic bitter feeling when you
are putting in a lot of work and you’re not seing the other reciprocate. This
is probably one of the number one way a side-project falls apart, and I’ve
witnessed it first hand from both sides. Essentially, this was meant to be a
fun project, and it was to remain fun until the end.  It would be done when it
would be done, and it would be done only if both of us wanted to work on it. I
believe this principle might have helped us keep this project alive for the
last three years.</p>

<h4 id="keep-it-small-stupid">Keep it Small, Stupid</h4>

<p>Now it was clear, we were going to make that game. It was time to work on
design and scoping. I had already released two games before starting this
project, so I had some experience in shipping games. My friend had never worked
on a game before though, so there would be some learning curve there. I was
well aware of the feature-creep trap, so I tried to limit the scope as much as
possible.</p>

<p>And it was necessary. We started out with the idea of making a polished and
professional version of my very first mobile game. That seemed like a good
plan, as the original game would serve as a prototype that we would heavily
polish. That would ensure a limited scope and at the same time that would let
me address many of the limitations of the game. We would also target Android,
since that is what my original game targeted, and this is what I have the most
familiarity with.</p>

<p>But, at the time, I had a few other exciting prototypes. One of them was a
mobile platformer with some innovative controls, and we started exploring ideas
for that game. However this was way more ambitious than the original plan,
would require a lot more content, a lot more programming, and generally a lot
more stuff. Eventually we agreed to table this exciting project for later, and
to focus on a first, small, easy game that we can release in a reasonable
window of time, in order to test if we can work together. If it would prove to
be a fruitful collaboration, we could revisit these other ideas later and work
on them.</p>

<p>Despite this heavy emphasis on keeping the scope small, the game still took
more than three years to complete. There are various reasons for that, for one,
it’s just what it takes; good products take time to craft. But there were other
reasons the project took that long. For one, we worked purely part time, and
even though we never gave up on the project, there were long periods of time
with no progress whatsoever.  Next, I insisted on using my own <a href="https://github.com/regb/scala-game-library">custom
engine</a>.  I just genuinely enjoy
programming, and I believe in learning by experience, so I have been developing
each on my game with my own engine that I keep improving over time. But that
means I have been spending a lot of time re-inventing the wheel. There’s also a
more pragmatic reason for that decision, which is that I want to use Scala for
writing my game, and there’s not that many engines out there. And a final
reason is that our experience in game development is still limited. We have
been figuring things out along the way, and that has added a lot of time to the
development.</p>

<h4 id="a-ground-up-redesign">A Ground Up Redesign</h4>

<p>You can try the original <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.regblanc.rattrap">Rat Trap game for
Android</a>.
If you played <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.limetalesgames.fishescapelite">Fish
Escape</a>,
it will feel familiar. To some people, their first reaction is that it’s the
same game. It’s fine, I am not getting upset by this. I know it took several
years of work, and I know what went into it. A good product is the collection
of thousands of small details. Fish Escape has these thousands more polished
details compared to Rat Trap, and I am convinced that the experience is vastly
superior. But if you just look at the overall gameplay, it will seem roughly
similar.</p>

<p>For reference, here is one of the last levels of Rat Trap:</p>

<div class="post-image-wrapper">
  
    <img src="/resources/rat-trap/screenshots/rat-trap-4.png" alt="Screenshot of Rat Trap version 1.0" />
    
  
</div>

<p>And without further ado, one of the last levels in Fish Escape:</p>

<div class="post-image-wrapper">
  
    <img src="/resources/fish-escape/screenshots/level-all-actions.png" alt="Screenshot of Fish Escape" />
    
  
</div>

<p>There are obvious differences, such as the change of theme (from trapping a rat
to trapping a penguin). We spent many months brainstorming on the best way to
visually represent each element of the gameplay and each action.  I am very
happy with how we were able to integrate the HUD into the background. By
opposition, in Rat Trap it was simply slapped on top of the screen.</p>

<p>Another visual, but less obvious difference, is the layout of the hexagonal
map. The game is designed for mobile, so our maps are at most 5x5, and we were
trying to optimize the space on the screen. You can see on the Rat Trap
screenshot that the map is pretty close to the edge on each side. Fish Escape
has a more natural and spacious margin on both edges. it’s not random. It comes
from the insight that phone screen are usually very tall, and that we have more
vertical than horizontal space available. That led us to changing the layout of
the map to align the tiles vertically instead of horizontally, which eventually
saved half a tile on the width.</p>

<p>Then there were technical improvements. The most important, but not necessarly
noticeable, is the penguin AI. The AI algorithm has been completely revamped,
to make it much, much, smarter. In Rat Trap, the AI was based on a simple
heuristics. It was a combination of a shortest path algorithm along with some
bonuses to favor directions with several objectives. This worked well most of
the time, until it did not. The annoying part is that some of the levels
designed for Rat Trap had no solution, and only worked because of the
particular heuristics used by the rat. The effect was that any improvement to
the AI would force me to revisit and potentially redesign levels, or run the
risk to make them infeasible.</p>

<p>In Fish Escape, I wanted to make the AI perfect. The goal was that if there was
a winning strategy, it would take it and beat the player. I believed that would
lead to a more satisfying experience for the player: they would be trying to
solve a puzzle, not trick an algorithm. I have definitely heard feedback about
how the rat made a mistake at X or Y move, and some players felt like they won
because the AI made a mistake, not because they made the right choice. A better
AI would fix this. And besides, a perfect AI would make sure that none of my
level design would get obsolete. That said, making that perfect AI turned out
to be a significant amount of work, and I had to make some compromise in order
to make it work. But this is a story for another day.</p>

<h4 id="monetization">Monetization</h4>

<p>Although this was a fun side project for both of us, we were very serious about
making money. From the get-go, we had the objective to make an extremely
polished game, with the potential to earn some hard cash. After all, if we were
to just complete a concept game, we could have released it two years ago. But
we spent two extra years fleshing out and polishing countless edges because we
wanted to offer a high-quality experience.</p>

<p>Very early on, we discussed about the best way to monetize the game. There are
three classic monetization options: ad-supported, in-app purchases (IAP), and
premium. We were not very fond of adding ads in our game, not for any sort of
moral reason, but because that would have a direct impact on the player’s
experience. Additionally, our game was not meant to be replayed forever, it was
a concise experience with about a hundred hand-crafted levels, and once they
are completed, there are no reason to keep playing the game. We believed that
this was the right design for this game and did not want to implement specific
mecanisms to get people to play longer (so that they could watch more ads). For
similar reasons, we dismissed IAP.</p>

<p>That left us with the option of making a premium game. This was a very
appealing option and that’s the most common approach taken by indies. This is
also the most respected option for real games, as the majority (but not all of
them) of free-to-play games tend to be seen as an unethical and quick cash grab
(not saying they are, but I believe that’s how players tend to see them). In
contrast, most (but again, not all of them) premium games are usually
associated with a respectful player experience, pay once, get good value out of
the game. Having a premium game should also help us get some attention from
journalists, while trying to get press for a free game would be pretty
challenging.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the mobile landscape for premium games is tough, very tough.
There are a few noticeable exceptions (<a href="http://ridiculousfishing.com/">Ridiculous
Fishing</a>, <a href="http://asherv.com/threes/">Threes!</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_Valley_(video_game)">Monument Valley</a>,
among others, come to mind), but overall this is not a market for premium game.
That did still feel like the best fit for our game, and the future will tell us
if this was a good choice. We would like to believe that it’s still possible to
be making a living as a game developer by simply publishing good games and
selling them at a one-time price point.</p>

<h4 id="compromising-with-early-access">Compromising with Early Access</h4>

<p>And here we are, three years into the development, getting closer and closer to
the end. Although we never gave up on that project, there have been a lot of
slowdowns and extended breaks. And we can start to feel some project’s fatigue.
What’s worse, we are starting to lose faith in the premium model. We have this
feeling that we will release the game and it will just go unnoticed.</p>

<p>And this is something we are willing to accept. This is our first game, and
part of the objective is to put our studio on the map. Even if only a few
hundred people buy the game, as long as they have a good experience and
remember us, that’s mission accomplished. Maybe these hundred players will be
waiting for our next game, and they might be telling their friend about it.
Over time, if we manage to publish quality game after quality game, and if we
keep respecting our players, this could snow-ball into an actual business. And
even if it doesn’t, I will keep making games because I enjoy the activity.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we have been looking for ways to promote the game. Currently, we
have serious concerns over the rate of conversion from getting to the store
page to actually buying the game.  Our graphics are nice, but they are not a
selling point. We do not have a crazy, awe-inspiring, trailer that would
convince people. And on top of that, we do have any serious marketing budget to
reach a lot of players. But what we have is a strong core gameplay that sticks
with players, and a very polished in-game experience. These are things that do
not communicate well through our screenshots and videos, but that we think
players will feel when they start playing.</p>

<p>So, as a way to exploit that, we have been strongly considering making a demo
with a call to action at the end to buy the full game. That’s the old-school
way of selling games, and as far as I’m concerned, it’s a totally fine way to
go about it. However, it does not seem like a popular, let alone existing,
approach today, especially on the app stores. The modern version of the demo is
the in-game paywall in a free-to-play game, where you get the first N levels
for free, and then have to pay a one-time fee to unlock the complete game.</p>

<p>In all honesty, that would be a decent model for Fish Escape. It gives the
first levels away for free, let people try the game out, and if they like it,
they can pay a one-off fee to unlock the whole game. Eventually, we didn’t go
with that solution, and there are two reasons, none of them might be very good
though. The first reason, is a technical limitation. As I mentioned before, the
game is built on my own engine, and it does not support IAP. When I started
looking into the Google Play API for this, it looked overly complicated and I
lost motivation to implement it. One day I will, but this day is not today. The
second, more sensible reason has to do with player’s expectation. When a player
is faced with a paywall, there’s a tendency to get frustrated and lose trust
against the game. How do I know, as a player, that this is not just the first
of many paywalls, even though you’re telling it’s a one-time fee? People might
also leave negative reviews because they were never planning to spend any money
but then get access to only a few levels, thus they end up complaining about
the lack of content. There are also players which hate IAP, and they are going
to dismiss the game due to the mere fact that the store page displays that this
game contains IAP. That’s a pity, because these are the players we hope to
target, the players who are willing to spend a few bucks to get a proper game,
without ads and IAP.</p>

<p>In order to address these concerns, we can look at the pre-IAP implementation
of the paywall feature: using a Lite and a Pro version. That was a very
widespread pattern, where an app would be split into a small lite version (the
demo) and a paid version (the complete game).  These days, it’s very rare and
almost all apps are using the IAP paywall method. I’m not sure why. I can see
some advantages, like that having a single app is better for consolidation and
it’s easier to manage.  But on the other hand you hit some of the problems I
was discussing in the previous paragraph.</p>

<p>In the end, we’ve decided to go with the latter model. Technically, it was
easier to put in place. And there was this strong need to have a clean version
of the game, free of any ads or IAP, with an official, and final, displayed
price. There would be no hidden fee, you buy the game, you get the full
experience. The lite version would be there as a way to test the game before
buying it. And it would play on the game’s strength which is that once you
start playing, you get converted.</p>

<p>The last remaining question was about the scope of the lite version. Would this
be a true old-school demo, or should we do something else? We considered
several options, and decided to edge our bets. Essentially, we believe that
there a large majority of players that are just never going to spend a single
cent on mobile games. That’s a bit sad, but that’s probably true. These players
might actually like our game, but there’s no point in giving them only 10
levels, and on top of that we run the risk that they would just leave bad
reviews due to the lack of content. We can offer a bit more content, maybe half
of the complete game, which would still be several hours of playtime, and
monetize it with ads.  That would make the lite version a game with a decent
amount of content and supported by ads. For people that enjoys the game, they
can go and buy the complete, ad-free version, as soon as they are convinced.
For these who enjoy the game but do not want to spend money, they can enjoy a
decent amount of content by accepting to see ads. Hopefully, in the end
everyone get what they want.</p>

<p>As a closing note, there is one last factor that pushed us towards that model.
I mentioned at the start of this section that we were starting to feel tired
about the whole development process. At this point, it would just feel good to
release something.  Unfortunately, the game still needs a good amount of
polishing to reach the standards that we set out for. But it turns out that a
lot of that polishing is related to the latest levels of the game.  This means
that the lite version is fairly close to completion. And given that this is
meant to be a lite and free version, we thought it was acceptable for it to not
be as perfect as we want the final game to be. Bottom line is, we can, today,
release the lite version. We can get it to the market, use it to gather
feedback, while we work on finalizing the complete, premium version of the
game. Hopefully we will get a boost of confidence by having released something,
and we can start sharing it with more people.</p>

<p>In the short term, <em>Fish Escape Lite</em> is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.limetalesgames.fishescapelite">out and available for
Android</a>,
This is a major milestone for <a href="https://www.limetalesgames.com">LimeTales</a> —
the indie studio we founded to publish this game. In the coming months, we will
be polishing and finishing the premium version of <em>Fish Escape</em> and release it
as an ad-free, IAP-free, paid premium game on Android.</p>

<p>In the longer term, we hope that this is only the first of many games for our
young game studio. We doubt that <em>Fish Escape</em> will make enough money to
sustain us full time on this enterprise. But assuming the game has a moderate
success, we should be able to find the motivation to work on a new project
following a similar part-time model.</p>

<p><em>Although next time, we hope it’s going to take less than three years…</em></p>
