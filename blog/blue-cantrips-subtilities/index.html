          <p>As we all know, blue is the best color in Magic, and the most fun to play. Ok, maybe
not everybody will agree with the latter, but surely blue has had some of the most
broken cards ever printed. It is also the most played color in Legacy. Part of it is due
to the consistency that the blue cantrips bring.</p>

<p>Today I want to discuss the different blue cantrips that are commonly played in Modern and
Legacy. I will limit the discussion to deck manipulation cantrips, as they are the most
interesting ones. I will focus on the following cards:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Brainstorm</li>
  <li>Ponder</li>
  <li>Preordain</li>
  <li>Serum vision</li>
  <li>Sleight of hand</li>
</ul>

<p><img width="500" src="/resources/mtg/cantrips-panel.png" /></p>

<p>All of these serve essentially the same role, a cheap card that replaces itself while manipulating
the library. So let’s look at the subtilities of each of them.</p>

<h4 id="brainstorm">Brainstorm</h4>

<p><em>Brainstorm</em> is commonly considered the best card in Legacy, and the best blue
cantrip ever printed. It is definitely a very powerful spell. But without the
proper support — a shuffle effect — <em>Brainstorm</em> is actually rather weak.</p>

<p>Consider a regular limited deck, full of creatures and a couple removals. What
would happen if you threw a random <em>Brainstorm</em> in there. Suppose you get to play
<em>Brainstorm</em> on turn 1, you draw three cards and put back two. By turn 3, you
redrew the two cards you put back, and you have access to the same cards you
would have access to had you casted a <em>Peek</em> on turn 1.  In fact, with <em>Peek</em>
you would actually have some relevant information on what your opponent is up
to.</p>

<p>Have you actually accomplished anything by casting <em>Brainstorm</em>? In fact, yes,
you smoothed your turn 2 play. You were able to dig two cards deeper than if
you had not cast anything on turn one, and so you get a small chance of having
a better on-curve turn 2 play. However, this comes at the cost of tempo and
spell density. Tempo is the most concerning thing, sometimes you just don’t
have time to spend one mana to cast a spell that draws you into your next
spell. For such a limited upside of smoothing your next turn play, you probably
don’t want to put a card like that in your deck.</p>

<p>Among all the cantrips we consider here, <em>Brainstorm</em> is the only one which is
not able to truly manipulate the library. All it does, is to re-order the cards
you have access to, but after two turns, you get back to the starting point.
<em>Sleight of Hand</em> on the other hand gives you the possibility to choose the
best among two cards, and get rid of the other one, wich is a superior effect
in the above situation.</p>

<p>But, when you get access to shuffle effects, <em>Brainstorm</em> really shines. It can
fix land-heavy hands and it can shuffle away dead cards. In some situation, it
is straight up <em>Ancestral Recall</em>. While all of the other blue cantrips can
only give you access to one new card, <em>Brainstorm</em> can totally transformed the
texture of your hand with three new cards. This unique ability makes it clearly
the best cantrip, but it is funny that the card on its own is actually the
weakest of the 5.</p>

<h4 id="ponder">Ponder</h4>

<p><em>Ponder</em> is the cantrip that lets you look at the highest number of cards. You
can see up to 4 different cards, so if you desperately need a specific card,
this is your spell of choice. It also offers you the unique ability to shuffle
your deck, which is not irrelevant in combination with a card like
<em>Sensei’s Divining Top</em>.</p>

<p>On its own, <em>Ponder</em> is a slightly better <em>Brainstorm</em>. You get to look at the next
three cards and organize them to smooth out your draw, which on turn 1 is basically
the same as <em>Brainstorm</em>. As with <em>Brainstorm</em>, by turn 3 you have drawn all of the
three cards and won’t profit anymore of the <em>Ponder</em> effect. The extra ability to
shuffle away the top three cards if they don’t fit well in your draw makes <em>Ponder</em>
the better card in this situation.</p>

<p>So, just casting <em>Ponder</em> does not give you much card selection. You can decide
you don’t like the top cards, and get a fresh draw, but if you like one of the
three cards and want to keep it, you will have to keep all three of them. That
is, unless you have a shuffle effect.  If you are able to shuffle your library
after casting ponder and reorganizing the top, you essentially get to select
the best card out of the top three, all of that for one single blue mana.
Remember <em>Anticipate</em>? Some people play that card in Modern. That is why
casting <em>Ponder</em> with a fetch land up is good. Of course, you don’t have to
only take one of the card, you can also sequence the shuffle in order to take
two of the cards.</p>

<p>Just like <em>Brainstorm</em>, <em>Ponder</em> truly shines in a deck full of fetch lands.
This is what makes it the second most played cantrip in Legacy, and rightfully
so.</p>

<h4 id="preordain-and-serum-vision">Preordain and Serum Vision</h4>

<p>Now we get to the two strongest cantrips in isolation. That’s probably why they
were played heavily in standard, because they do not need shuffle effect to
shine.</p>

<p>They are also doing very similar effect, in that they get to cantrip (draw a
card) and scry 2. The only difference is the order in which these actions are
done. <em>Preordain</em> scries first, then draw, and <em>Serum Vision</em> draws first then
scries. This subtle difference leads to one being banned in Modern and the
other one being played, rather reluctantly, in Modern.</p>

<p>Several Modern players have been complaining how <em>Serum Vision</em> is terrible,
but that it’s the only available cantrip in the format. Given that the next
best option is <em>Sleight of Hand</em>, it is clear that <em>Serum Vision</em> is the best
option available. It’s also cleary by design, as Wizards made it clear that
they do not want a Modern format that look like Legacy. In all fairness, I
think <em>Serum Vision</em> is not as bad as that, and there are cases where it’s
actually better than <em>Preordain</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s first consider the cards on their own. With <em>Serum Vision</em>, you draw a
random card, and then you set up your draw for the next one or two turns. With
<em>Preordain</em>, you get to set up your draw first, so you actually get the card
that you want right away. That’s pretty powerful, and that makes <em>Preordain</em>
extremely good in a combo deck looking for a key combo piece. That’s also the
main reason <em>Preordain</em> is seen as so much better than <em>Serum Vision</em>.</p>

<p>But consider playing both cards on turn one. Let’s say you get to see one good
and one bad card, with <em>Preordain</em>, you remove the bad card, draw the good one,
then next turn you draw a random card. With <em>Serum Vision</em>, you draw the bad
card, keep the good one on top for next turn, and get to choose if you want to
keep the random card. It’s not hard to see that this is pretty much equivalent,
swap the bad card with the random card, and you get the same effect. If you
don’t get to use the card right away, both cards are mostly equivalent. In
fact, <em>Serum Vision</em> has some advantages here, because you get to draw first,
you then have more information to choose what to do with your scry. As an
example, say you are looking for exactly one copy of <em>X</em>, not two, but one. Now
suppose there are three <em>X</em> on top of your deck. With <em>Preordain</em>, you will
keep one and bottom one, but next turn you will end up drawing the extra one,
ending up with with a redundant copy. With <em>Serum Vision</em>, you get to draw the
first one right away, then see the two additional ones, and can take the
decision to bottom them knowing that you already fount the one you needed. The
extra information of drawing first was quite handy there.</p>

<h4 id="sleight-of-hand">Sleight of Hand</h4>

<p>There’s not much to say on <em>Sleight of Hand</em>. It’s a fine cantrip, which is
most of the time inferior to all the other discussed here. It has the same
advantage as <em>Preordain</em> over <em>Serum Vision</em> that it gets to use the card right
away. But the major drawback is that you are forced to choose exactly one card,
which does not smooth your draw too much.</p>

<p>It’s fine for combo in Modern, but it will hardly find a place in anything
else, and it cannot compete with the other cantrips in Legacy.</p>

<h4 id="sequencing">Sequencing</h4>

<p>To finish this article, I will go over a few tips&amp;tricks of how to properly
sequence your cantrips. It’s all based on the observation above, and once you
get familiar with the strength of each cantrip, it should become second nature.</p>

<p>The most important, and usually easiest to mess up, element is to take into
account your shuffle effects. Most commonly, these are your fetches. You should
use them to the best of your ability to shuffle away cards that you do not want
anymore, and more importantly you should avoid shuffling cards that you know
you want.  The latter seems obvious, but it’s all too common to use a <em>Serum
Vision</em>, set the top two cards, only draw one and then realize you need to
fetch a land because you need the mana. This is something that should be
planned one or two turns in advance.</p>

<p>Regarding shuffling away cards that you do not want, there’s the obvious
<em>Brainstorm</em> and <em>Ponder</em> play, where you shuffle away cards that you do not
need anymore, or you combine <em>Ponder</em> and shuffle to select one or two of the
top three. Then there’s the less obvious case of keeping speculative cards on
top with <em>Serum Vision</em> or <em>Preordain</em>, and decide later if you still want
them.  You might for example leave a <em>removal</em> on top of the deck, but then
your opponent takes their first turn and go <em>Underground Sea</em> into <em>Cabal
Therapy</em>. At this point, it’s pretty clear they are playing Storm and you will
want to shuffle away this removal, if you can.</p>

<p>The last piece of advice with shuffling is to try to fetch first and use scries
later.  Any card that you put under your deck won’t be drawn again in this
game, until it’s shuffled back in. So if you know you don’t want these cards,
you may want to try to sequence your shuffles first and only then your scries.
This is also a common source of mistake, where people are going to fetch in
order to thin their deck, but they already had three bad cards on the bottom.
At this point, they are basically doing the opposite, by making bad draws more
dense in the deck.</p>

<p>Apart from shuffling, the general advice follows the same insight as to why
<em>Serum Vision</em> is sometimes better than <em>Preordain</em>. You should aim at getting
more cards first, before you play cards with a lot of selection. It’s always
good ot start with <em>Serum Vision</em> on turn one, because you will need extra time
to get to the next cards, which you usually have on turn one. As long as you
have time, you should favor the cards that take more time to setup, such as
<em>Ponder</em>, where you might need two extra turn to draw all the cards. You should
keep the <em>Brainstorm</em> and <em>Preordain</em> for the more explosive turns, where you
need to get one answer and you need to play it right away.</p>
