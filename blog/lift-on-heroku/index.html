        <article class="post-content">
          <p>I recently started working on a <a href="http://www.sprayhere.com">new project</a> and 
decided to go with Scala and the <a href="http://liftweb.net">Lift framework</a> for the 
backend.</p>

<p>I like Lift a lot, having build a <a href="http://www.timestash.com">previous website</a>
entirely using it. Since then, it became my “go to” standard for whenever I
had to build something web-related.</p>

<p>For this project, we had to build a mobile application and a backend server to
share the data between the (hopefully) many clients. I was not too familiar
with the best way to have mobile applications communicate with a server, but I
decided to just jump in and chose the simplest solution that I knew:
implementing an HTTP-based server and have the clients communicate with it
using an HTTP library.</p>

<p>I wanted to experiment with something new for the hosting. I used to work with
dedicated machines or VPS, but that was a bit of a pain to maintain. I had
heard a lot of good things about <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>, so I decided
to give it a try.</p>

<p>The great thing with Heroku is that, once setup, deploying is as simple as
doing a <code class="highlighter-rouge">git push</code>.  However, all this simplicity comes to the price of
flexibility. If you want to use Heroku, you have to build your application in a
very specific way — the Heroku way. In particular, you can no longer organize
your architecture around full computer boxes, but need to think of your
application as a collection of different processes, independent of the rest of
the system.</p>

<p>That means two things. One, you can no longer rely on the local filesystem or
memory being in an expected state accross several requests, and two, you will
need to connect with several external services for tasks such as persistence.</p>

<p>Essentially, Heroku forces you to build stateless applications. That is,
applications that handle requests in a stateless manner, with no dependency on
any previously completed requests. Concretely, that means we will not have a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">login</code> request that sets session data on the server and remembers which user
correctly logged in, but instead, each request that needs authentication will
contain some sort of credentials to identify and authorize the client.</p>

<p>Building a stateless application is very good when you need to scale
horizontally. Since a server treats each request in a stateless way, it is
straightforward to fire up additional copies of the same server and have a
load-balancer dispatches the request to the least busy server. In fact, that is
exactly what Heroku is doing, only that the dispatching is done randomly, which
on average is pretty much the same. In theory, if you implement your backend
properly with Heroku, you can scale up by just flipping a switch in the Heroku
console.</p>

<p>But Lift is relying on state. Sessions are combined with closures to handle
ajax callbacks in a very convenient and efficient way. This is a powerful
feature, but it means that a Lift server is not stateless, as the follow-up
ajax requests will need to be handle by the same server that created the
closures in the first place. There is a known solution around this problem:
<em>sticky sessions</em>.  Sticky sessions are a configuration mode for load-balancer
that simply make sure that all requests in the same session are always routed
to the same server. That does not solve the issue of a server restart during a
session, but in most cases this is a perfectly fine solution.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Heroku does not support sticky sessions. You have no control over
the Heroku load-balancer, it simply routes each request independently and randomly to an
instance of your application. Does it mean we cannot use Lift when hosting on Heroku?
No, but it means we have to avoid the stateful features of Lift.</p>

<p>In our case, we wanted to use Lift to build an HTTP API for a mobile client. Lift provides
a <code class="highlighter-rouge">RestHelper</code> helper trait which facilitates the creation of web services. We start
by defining some API endpoints, let’s take a user system API for example:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">UserAPI</span> <span class="k">extends</span> <span class="nc">RestHelper</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="nf">serve</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"api"</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="s">"users"</span> <span class="n">prefix</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nc">AsLong</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">::</span> <span class="nc">Nil</span> <span class="nc">Get</span> <span class="k">_</span> <span class="k">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">???</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="nc">AsLong</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">::</span> <span class="nc">Nil</span> <span class="nc">JsonPut</span> <span class="n">json</span> <span class="k">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">???</span>
  <span class="o">})</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This defines two URLs for our API. The first one accepts a <code class="highlighter-rouge">GET</code> request and is
supposed to return a resource representing the user represented by its <code class="highlighter-rouge">id</code>.
The second one is meant to update the user based on a <code class="highlighter-rouge">json</code> resource object
received as part of the request. The implementation of these endpoints are
relatively simple but dependent on your system. Essentially, it is a couple
simple database queries to get and update the data of the user. It is essential
that those do not rely on session data provided by Lift (most of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">S</code> object).</p>

<p>Next, we can setup <code class="highlighter-rouge">Boot.scala</code> in the following way:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-scala" data-lang="scala"><span class="nv">LiftRules</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">enableContainerSessions</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="kc">false</span>
<span class="nv">LiftRules</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">statelessReqTest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">append</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="k">case</span> <span class="k">_</span> <span class="k">=&gt;</span> <span class="kc">true</span> <span class="o">}</span>

<span class="nv">LiftRules</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">statelessDispatch</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="py">append</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">UserAPI</span><span class="o">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This forces Lift to operate in stateless mode. It will even throw an exception
if you have some code relying on session data. In the final statement, we
append the <code class="highlighter-rouge">UserAPI</code> instance to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">statelessDispatch</code> list that Lift goes
through before initializing session state when receiving a request. There is
a similar <code class="highlighter-rouge">dispatch</code> list, but that one is run in stateful mode.</p>

<p>It’s also possible to use snippets and templates to render HTML. It comes with
the same limitation of not having access to session data. Additionally, all the
ajax server-side functionnalities will not work as they rely on Scala closures
stored in memory. But snippets and template are functional, and our
<a href="http://www.sprayhere.com">website</a> is built using them, and hosted on Heroku as
well.</p>

<p>Configuration is also slightly different on Heroku. Heroku heavily uses
environment variables to configure each application. This is how the database
connection credentials are preferably communicated to the application. In
contrast, Lift provides built-in support for <code class="highlighter-rouge">.props</code> file that contains
properties used for configuration. In this project, we implemented a system
that would check for a configuration variable in the environment variable
first, and then default to the value found in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.props</code> file. The
possibility to set environment variables from the Heroku web interface makes it
extremely painless to modify the configuration of the system.</p>

<p><em>Edit on May 29, 2016:</em>
If you want to check out the product we are building with Scala and Lift, we recently
released <a href="http://www.sprayhere.com"><em>SprayHere</em></a>, a geo-localized platform to communicate
with people around you. We are launching it locally, at EPFL in Lausanne. You can get
the Android app in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sprayhere">Google Play</a>.</p>
